message: "Hi Luke,\r\n1. I failed to see what you think is wrong here.\r\n2. Spring does add a minimum of 1, or used to when I wrote this article. I don't remember which class was doing so, and unfortunately, I don't have the time to go find out now. If you've not already done so, I suggest you look into the actual code and not be swayed by the result of the experiments."
