message: "Hi , thanks for the post. I would like to ask if the cloud config support dynamic key lookup ? e.g.  if I want to use the git config as error message properties, the key will be dynamically determined by business logic.  But so far I can see the example only show me how to retrieve property statically using @value annotation. Do you have idea on this ?\r\nTHanks a lot."
