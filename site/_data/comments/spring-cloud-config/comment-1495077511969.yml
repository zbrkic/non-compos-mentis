  @William, as I mentioned, the config server always pulls from Git in response
  to a request. It's up to the client how to utilize that feature and strike a
  balance between dynamism and performance. Messages are not likely to change so
  often that you'd need to look up for every request. There are various options,
  which are beyond the scope of discussion here. Feel free to contact me by
  email (found on the home page) if you've further questions.
