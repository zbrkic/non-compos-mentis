> Suppose we are given a directed graph $$ G (V,E) $$ in which every edge has a distinct positive edge weight. A directed graph is acyclic if it has no directed cycle. Suppose that we want to compute the maximum-weight acyclic subgraph of $$ G $$ (where the weight of a subgraph is the sum of its edges' weights). Assume that $$ G $$ is weakly connected, meaning that there is no cut with no edges crossing it in either direction.
>
> Here is an analog of Prim's algorithm for directed graphs. Start from an arbitrary vertex $$ s $$, initialize $$ S = \{s\} $$ and $$ F = \emptyset $$. While $$ S \neq V $$, find the maximum-weight edge $$ (u,v) $$ with one endpoint in $$ S $$ and one endpoint in  $$ V -S $$. Add this edge to $$ F $$, and add the appropriate endpoint to $$ S $$.
>
> Here is an analog of Kruskal's algorithm. Sort the edges from highest to lowest weight. Initialize $$ F=\emptyset $$. Scan through the edges; at each iteration, add the current edge $$ i $$ to $$ F $$ if and only if it does not create a directed cycle.

> Which of the following is true?
* Both algorithms might fail to compute a maximum-weight acyclic subgraph.
* Only the modification of Kruskal's algorithm always computes a maximum-weight acyclic subgraph.
* Only the modification of Prim's algorithm always computes a maximum-weight acyclic subgraph.
* Both algorithms always compute a maximum-weight acyclic subgraph.

**ANSWER:** Consider the two-node graph $$ A \xrightarrow{10} B \xrightarrow{6} A, B \xrightarrow{7} A $$ (yes, two edges from $$ B $$ to $$ A $$; nothing in the question precludes that). Analog of Prim's creates a cycle no matter which vertex it chooses first. Analog of Kruskal's chooses $$ A \rightarrow B $$ and then halt. However, the maximum-weight acyclic subgraph consists of the two edges $$ B \rightarrow A $$ which either algorithms fails to find. Thus, option 1 is correct.

> Consider a connected undirected graph $$ G $$ with edge costs that are not necessarily distinct. Suppose we replace each edge cost $$ c_e $$ with $$ -c_e $$; call this new graph $$ G' $$. Consider running either Kruskal's or Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on $$ G' $$, with ties between edge costs broken arbitrarily, and possibly differently, in each algorithm. Which of the following is true?
* Both algorithms compute the same maximum-cost spanning tree of $$ G $$.
* Both algorithms compute a maximum-cost spanning tree of $$ G $$, but they might compute different ones.
* Prim's algorithm computes a maximum-cost spanning tree of $$ G $$ but Kruskal's algorithm might not.
* Kruskal's algorithm computes a maximum-cost spanning tree of $$ G $$ but Prim's algorithm might not.

**ANSWER:** Option 2 is correct; different tie-breaking rules may yield different spanning trees.

> Consider the following algorithm that attempts to compute a minimum spanning tree of a connected undirected graph $$ G $$ with distinct edge costs. First, sort the edges in decreasing cost order (i.e., the opposite of Kruskal's algorithm). Initialize $$ T $$ to be all edges of $$ G $$. Scan through the edges (in the sorted order), and remove the current edge from $$ T $$ if and only if it lies on a cycle of $$ T $$.
>
> Which of the following statements is true?
* The output of the algorithm will never have a cycle, but it might not be connected.
* The algorithm always outputs a spanning tree, but it might not be a minimum cost spanning tree.
* The output of the algorithm will always be connected, but it might have cycles.
* The algorithm always outputs a minimum spanning tree.

**ANSWER:** During the iteration in which an edge is removed, it was on a cycle $$ C $$ of $$ T $$. By the sorted ordering, it must be the maximum-cost edge of $$ C $$. By an exchange argument, it cannot be a member of any MST. Since every edge deleted by the algorithm belongs to no MST, and its output is a spanning tree (no cycles by construction, connected by the Lonely Cut Corollary), its output must be the (unique) MST. Therefore, option 4 is correct.

> You are given a connected undirected graph $$ G $$ with distinct edge costs, in adjacency list representation. You are also given the edges of a minimum spanning tree $$ T $$ of $$ G $$. This question asks how quickly you can recompute the MST if we change the cost of a single edge. Which of the following are true? [RECALL: It is not known how to deterministically compute an MST from scratch in $$ O(m) $$ time, where $$ m $$ is the number of edges of $$ G $$.] [Check all that apply.]
* Suppose $$ e \in T $$ and we increase the cost of $$ e $$. Then, the new MST can be recomputed in $$ O(m) $$ deterministic time.
* Suppose $$ e \notin T $$ and we increase the cost of $$ e $$. Then, the new MST can be recomputed in $$ O(m) $$ deterministic time.
* Suppose $$ e \in T $$ and we decrease the cost of $$ e $$. Then, the new MST can be recomputed in $$ O(m) $$ deterministic time.
* Suppose $$ e \notin T $$ and we decrease the cost of $$ e $$. Then, the new MST can be recomputed in $$ O(m) $$ deterministic time.

**ANSWER:** Option 1: Let $$ A,B $$ be the two connected components of $$ T - \{e\} $$. Edge $$ e $$ no longer belongs to the new MST if and only if it is no longer the cheapest edge crossing the cut $$ (A,B) $$ (this can be checked in $$ O(m) $$ time). If $$ f $$ is the new cheapest edge crossing $$ (A,B) $$, then the new MST is $$ T - \{e\} \cup \{f\} $$.

Option 2 and 3: The MST does not change, so no re-computation is needed.

Option 4: Let C be the cycle of $$ T \cup \{e\} $$. Edge $$ e $$ belongs to the new MST if and only if it is no longer the most expensive edge of $$ C $$ (this can be checked in $$ O(m) $$ time). If $$ f $$ is the new most expensive edge of $$ C $$, then the new MST is $$ T \cup \{e\} - \{f\} $$.

Thus, all four options are correct.

> Consider an alphabet with five letters, $$ \{a,b,c,d,e\} $$, and suppose we know the frequencies $$ f_a = 0.32, f_b = 0.25, f_c = 0.2, f_d = 0.18, \text{ and } f_e = 0.05 $$. What is the expected number of bits used by Huffman's coding scheme to encode a 1000-letter document?
* 3450
* 2400
* 3000
* 2230

**ANSWER:** Recall from lecture video 8.3, the average encoding length $$ L(T) $$ is given by $$ \sum_{i \in \Sigma} (P_i \cdot [\text{depth of i in T}]) $$. A binary tree for the alphabet in question is given below.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/algorithms-design-analysis-2-2.jpg" alt="Binary Tree" %}

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  L(T) & = (0.32 + 0.25 + 0.2) * 2 + (0.18 + 0.05) * 3 \\
   & = 1.54 + 0.69 \\
   & = 2.23
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
$$

Therefore, for a 1000-letter document, the expected number of bits is $$ 2230 $$. Option 4 is correct.

> Which of the following statements holds for Huffman's coding scheme?
* If the most frequent letter has frequency less than $$ 0.5 $$, then all letters will be coded with more than one bit.
* A letter with frequency at least $$ 0.5 $$ might get encoded with two or more bits.
* If a letter's frequency is at least $$ 0.4 $$, then the letter will certainly be coded with only one bit.
* If the most frequent letter has frequency less than $$ 0.33 $$, then all letters will be coded with at least two bits.

**ANSWER:** Option 1 is incorrect; counterexample: Frequencies 0.49, 0.48, and 0.3.

Option 2 is incorrect. A letter with frequency at least $$ 0.5 $$ is going to be the last one to be merged, because there cannot be any other letter with higher frequency.

Option 3 is incorrect; counterexample: Frequencies 0.4, 0.4, and 0.2.

Option 4 is correct. Such a letter will endure a merge in at least two iterations: the last one (which involves all letters), and at least one previous iteration. In the penultimate iteration, if the letter has not yet endured a merge, at least one of the two other remaining subtrees has cumulative frequency at least $$ \frac{1 - 0.33}{2} \gt 0.33 $$, so the letter will get merged in this iteration.
