> Recall the asynchronous version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm discussed in the "Internet Routing" lectures. Prove that, in the worst case, this algorithm requires an exponential number of iterations to converge.

**ANSWER:** Formal proof TBD. [This](http://www.keyboardbanger.com/distance-vector-protocols-the-bellman-ford-algorithm/) article has good examples of exponential convergence for the synchronous algorithm.
